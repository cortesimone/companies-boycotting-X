Elon Musk pushed back on advertisers boycotting X over antisemitism and other hate speech on the platform formerly known as Twitter during the 2023 DealBook Summit in New York on Wednesday.

What he's saying: "If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising? Blackmail me with money? Go f**k yourself." Musk said. "Don't advertise."
